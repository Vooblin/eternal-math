Welcome to Eternal Math's documentation!
==========================================

**Eternal Math** is an open-source software platform designed as a comprehensive, 
ever-evolving toolkit for exploring, proving, and generating mathematical concepts.

The platform provides a Python-based framework for mathematical computation, 
theorem proving, and concept exploration, combining computational tools with 
formal proof systems to create an integrated environment for mathematical 
research and education.

.. note::

   This project is under active development and welcomes contributions from the community.
